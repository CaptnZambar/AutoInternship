I want you to an app that sends automatically personalized emails (with attachments) from my outlook app using an database as a reference. I am using Windows 11.

The technology you will have to use is Python (Flask App). Feel to choose the optimal language for the database.

In the structure, you'll have a template folder named "templates" with:
- cv.docx: a template of my cv with a placeholder {{ role }}.
- cover_letter_french.docx: a template of my cover letter in french with placeholder {{ date }}, {{ job }}, {{ company }}, {{ name }}
- cover_letter_english.docx: a template of my cover letter in english with placeholder {{ date }}, {{ job }}, {{ company }}, {{ name }}, {{ signature }}
- mail_french.txt: a template of the mail in french to send also with the placeholder {{ name }} and {{ job }}.
- mail_english.txt: a template of the mail in english to send also with the placeholder {{ name }} and {{ job }}.

The database will have these columns: email, job, company, name, role, language.
The user should be able to easely see, modify, delete this database.

Here is a detailed explanation of how the app should work:

For each row in the db:

1. Generation of the CV
According to the role, you'll generate in PDF the cv replacing the placeholder role with role corresponding to the db. The CV should be named "CV - Justin Isambert.pdf".

2. Generation of the Cover Letter
Similarly, you'll generate in PDF the cover letter choosing the right language and replacing the placeholders. The cover letter should be named "Cover Letter - Justin Isambert.pdf".
For the English version, if a name is provided, {{ name }} should be replaced and {{ signature }} would be "Yours sincerely". If no name is provided, {{ name }} is equal to "Sir or Madam" and {{ signature }} to "Yours faithfully". Met la date du jour pour {{ date }}.
Dans la lettre en français, si {{ name }} est donné, alors remplace le. Sinon, {{ name }} == "Madame, Monsieur". Il n'y a pas {{ signature }} donc ne t'en occupe pas.

3. Sending the email with attachements CV and Cover Letter
I have both Outlook Classic and Outlook New (process name "olk.exe") installed on my windows machine. I prefer using Outlook New but if it is not possible use Outlook Classic. 

You'll write DRY code using best practices, and using an efficient logging system.
